        The existing mentorship program lacks a dedicated component to support the personal and professional development of ERCI investigators. It does not facilitate mentor-mentee relationships within the ERCI function specifically.
      </p>
      <p class="fade-in">
        This project proposes the creation of a mentorship program tailored to ERCI investigators, emphasizing knowledge sharing between new and experienced team members. The program would align mentors with mentees based on developmental goals, helping strengthen investigative expertise and fostering leadership within the ERCI team.
