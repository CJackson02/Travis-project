      <p class="fade-in">
        An ERCI Investigator is responsible for conducting objective, thorough, and timely investigations into reported high-risk employee relations concerns across multiple Amazon business lines. These investigations can potentially include allegations of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, workplace violence, and other allegations of misconduct. The ERCI investigator ensures investigative compliance in partnership with legal, Human Resources, physical security teams and compliance teams to assess risk, mitigate potential liabilities, and ensure fair treatment of employees while maintaining organizational standards and compliance with employment laws.

      <p class="fade-in">
        Investigators will conduct end-to-end investigations into complex and sensitive workplace matters. The investigative process will include interviewing, analyzing evidence, documenting findings, making recommendations and advising accountability for policy violations. The investigator will apply principles of investigative interviewing, neutrality, and fact-finding to assess credibility and ensure a fair process for all parties involved. At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator will provide the findings of the investigation via a detailed written investigation report that that is legally and internally sound to stand up to legal and/or ethical challenges. An ERCI investigator is expected to partner with cross-functional teams such as Legal, HR, Security, and Business Leadership to provide guidance on ER issues and foster a respectful and compliant workplace culture.

        In order to properly support these requirements, investigators must be provided the proper infrastructure which partners newer and less experienced investigators with more tenured and experienced investigators.
