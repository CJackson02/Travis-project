    <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
    <p>The Central Investigations Mentorship Program is an initiative designed to support investigators’ growth, strengthen investigative expertise, and promote a departmental opportunity to continuously learn and develop. By matching investigators based on strengths and opportunities provided by the participants, the program aims to enhance professional competencies, maintain quality decision making and support the development of investigators. This initiative directly aligns with Central Investigations’ commitment to team development and will be utilized as a step to increase engagement and continued growth within the Central Investigations department.</p>

    <p>The program’s design is established within the best practices of the investigations team and will allow both mentors and mentees to participate in numerous mentor/mentee opportunities. Each mentor/mentee pairing will establish their own cadence and content. The leadership team will be available for recommendations if needed but the program will not dictate the path of the mentor/mentee journey. Supporting tools such as Forte, performance reviews, supervisor feedback and professional development plans can be considered when the mentor/mentee establish the goals of the relationship. Mentors/mentees will complete their profile which will include information such as tenure, strengths, opportunities, career goals, and “superpowers” and the system will pair mentors/mentees based on these (among other factors). Mentors/mentees can also manually create a mentor/mentee relationship in the system if they currently have a mentor/mentee relationship. Additionally, a mentee will have the opportunity to set parameters with what their goals are when being assigned a mentor. For example, if an investigator is preparing for a promotional interview, the mentee can request a “flash” mentorship that will be brief and will have the sole intent of preparing the mentee for said interview.</p>

    <p>Program development has involved collaboration with the senior leadership team and a cross-section of investigators from varying investigations verticals to ensure the model reflects the diverse functions and needs of Investigators and the overall Central Investigations team. A pilot program will launch with minimal participants to test the functionality of the program and gather feedback which will allow the program the ability to be refined and adjusted before a full-scale implementation. All materials and timelines have been created with input from stakeholders to ensure the model is sustainable and meets the needs of the Central Investigations department.</p>

    <p>Evaluation of the mentorship program will focus on participation rates, feedback from participants, match rate for participants and engagement scores. In addition, qualitative feedback from participants will be gathered/analyzed to assess the quality of relationships and overall program satisfaction. This data will help shape future iterations of the program and the results will be shared with the Leadership Team to help guide the future direction of the program. Ultimately, the Central Investigations Mentorship Program strives to be a tool that can positively impact the department’s long-term developmental goals.</p>
